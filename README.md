# Repo for software based PWM learning

This is to learn and develop a library for software PWM generation.

Should be useful for EX-IOExpander LED dimming and generating a 38KHz-ish signal for reliable IR sensors.

Starting with the [Bald Engineer](https://www.baldengineer.com/software-pwm-with-millis.html#:~:text=One%20option%20is%20to%20change%20boards%20and%20processors.,pin%20to%20OUTPUT%2C%20you%20can%20use%20this%20technique.)

Also for faster pin writes, direct writing along the lines of the [Arduino forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/faster-digitalwrite-solved/619295/26)
