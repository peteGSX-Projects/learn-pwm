# Repo for software based PWM learning

This is to learn and develop a library for software PWM generation.

Should be useful for EX-IOExpander LED dimming and generating a 38KHz-ish signal for reliable IR sensors.

Also for faster pin writes, direct writing along the lines of the [Arduino forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/faster-digitalwrite-solved/619295/26)
